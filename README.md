# Haxball Headless Bot
A feature-rich, yet lightweight Haxball bot. 

Saves you from many chores of manually moderating a Haxball room.


# Main Features
- Automatically mutes spammers
- You can blacklist players based on IP address or nickname
- A lot of handy chat commands and hidden admin mode
- Command prefix is `.` (`!` also works)


# Quick Start
- Go to [https://www.haxball.com/headless](https://www.haxball.com/headless) and open the browser console (shortcut: <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>)
- Copy-paste the bot code into the console and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
- Done! Open the room URL on a new tab (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>LeftClick</kbd>) to join the game
- Type `.help` in chat or see [Chat commands wiki](https://github.com/uzayyli/Haxball-Headless-Bot/wiki/Chat-Commands) for the list of commands


# Customizing
It is recommended to edit a few things before running the bot. These can be found at the very beginning of the code. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) can be useful for editing stuff.
## Room name
Type a custom room name like this:
```javascript
roomName:"ðŸ‘½ My Room Name",
```

## Max players
You can also edit the player capacity of the room:
```javascript
maxPlayers:12,
```

## Admin passwords
You should edit this part near the beginning of the file:
```javascript
["admin1","admin2","admin3","admin4"]
```
Each password is for a different admin level. L1 admins can only stop/start the games etc. L3 and L4 admins can kick / ban / blacklist people, so be careful who you share this password with.

* Notes for admins:
  * When you join the room, you can get admin rights by typing `.admin aDmInPw#*123` in chat
  * You can become a hidden admin by typing `.admin aDmInPw#*123 hidden`. Your name will not be highlighted in yellow but you will still be able to use admin commands. It is useful to detect naughty players etc.
  * Password is case-sensitive and cannot have spaces
  * You can set another player's admin level with `.setadminlevel [playerName] 2 (hidden)`

## Stadium data
If you want to load your custom maps with chat commands, edit this part:
```javascript
mapsUrl:"https://example.com/my_maps.json"
```
Stadium data should be a valid JSON object where keys are map names and values are `*.hbs` file contents. An example can be found [here](https://api.jsonbin.io/b/60f97503a263d14a2979f185). The object should look like this:
```javascript
{
  "Futsal":{hbs:{"name":"..."}},
  "LongBounce":{m:"Custom message for this stadium",hbs:{"name":"..."}},
  "etc":{m:"",hbs:{"name":"..."}}
}
```
Notice there is no comma at the end of last stadium. It is recommended to minify your hbs files with a JSON minifier.

You can parse a different JSON file using this command: `.maps fetch [url_new_JSON_file]`
